<h2><a name="launch">Launch TDA</a></h2>
<p><a href="tda.jnlp"><img border="0" src="webstart.gif"></a> Launch the current TDA 2.0 release from the browser (requires Java Webstart). On Windows it will automatically create a shortcut on your desktop and in your Windows menu. Unfortuneately there is no way to tell Java Webstart to ask first if you want to install the shortcut.</p>

<h2><a name="background">Background</a></h2>
<p>There is a quite nice Thread Dump Analysis Tool for Websphere environments but which only works with IBM JDKs. Motivation for
this little tool was to have something similar for Sun JDKs. See <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javapedia/ThreadDump">JavaPedia: ThreadDump</a> for links.</p>

<h2><a name="summary">Project Summary</a></h2>
<p>The <b>TDA</b> Thread Dump Analyzer for Java is a small Swing GUI for analyzing Thread Dumps and Heap Information generated by the Sun Java VM (currently tested with 1.4.x, 1.5.0_x and 1.6.0_x releases). It parses the thread dumps and class histograms from a provided log file. TDA needs at least Java 1.4.2_x to run.</p>
<p>
It provides statistic informations about the found thread dumps, gives information about locked monitors and waiting threads. It can diff between threads to look for similarities and has a "long-running-thread" detection. It also provides overview of heap objects at a thread dump, if class histogram was logged.</p>
<p>
Features are in detail:
<ul>
<li>Parsing all thread dumps of a log file, using a specified regular expression for log file time stamps (thread dumps don't have any date information by default), displaying them in a tree.
<li>Display of statistic data about the found thread dumps, display of monitors, waiting, sleeping and locking threads,
<li>dumps provide links in context for easy dump navigation,
<li>integrated class histogram analysis for a specific thread dump (using the -XX:+PrintClassHistogram option of the VM), can also be parsed from a second file, if loggc-Option was used (to log garbage collections to a different log file).
<li>displays deadlock information from the thread dump,
<li>displays hints about possible problems in the analyzed dumps and
<li>ability to add additional logfiles (useful if logfiles are rotated) or open many at once.
<li>Session handling to be able to reopen a tda session.
<li>Integration into JConsole as plugin.
<li>A <a href="http://visualvm.dev.java.net">VisualVM</a> plugin.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The emphasis of the TDA is to provide analysis support of offline information gathered from production environments.</p>

<p>In addition to TDA you might find the <a href="http://www.tagtraum.com/gcviewer.html">GCViewer</a> helpful. It parses the output of the garbage collector from a loggc file and displays it graphically, so you can analyse the memory usage over the time.</p>

<p>TDA includes a help overview giving detailed information on how to use the tool.</p>

<h2><a name="download">Download</a></h2>
<p>
You can either download the 2.2 Final release in the <a href="/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">files</a> section or install it through Java Webstart, which is prefered (see <a href="tda.jnlp">link</a> above). Look at the usage overview in the help menu for further information. Start scripts in zip distribution are quite basic, look inside them, you might need to adjust the memory settings if you want to parse very huge log files (>250MB).</p>
