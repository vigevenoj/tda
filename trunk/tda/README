TDA - Thread Dump Analyzer -- Version 0.1

To run the application call "java -jar dist/tda.jar" and open the log file to parse.
The analyzer will automatically parse and display all found dumps in the log file. 
As it reads all data into memory, Xmx might need to be set accordingly if big log
files are read. 

Note: This is a prerelease of the software, there is no real documentation on reading
the thread dumps available currently.

Important Known Bug: The tool currently has a memory leak which crashes the tool if
too many log files are opened as it doesn't release data of old dumps properly.
