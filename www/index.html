<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
<p>Provide a small utility helping offline analysis of production enviroments like application servers.</p> 

 
 <br>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>There is a quite nice Thread Dump Analysis Tool for Websphere environments but which only works with IBM JDKs. Motivation for
this little tool was to have something similar for Sun JDKs </p>

<br>
<h4>Project Summary</h4>
<p>The <b>TDA</b> Thread Dump Analyzer is a small Swing GUI for analyzing Thread Dumps generated by the SUN JVM (currently tested with 1.4.x releases). It parses the thread dumps from a provided log file. </p>
<p>
It provides statistics informations about the found thread dumps, gives information about locked monitors and waiting threads. It can diff between threads to look for similarities and has a "long-running-thread" detection.
<p>
Features are in detail:
<ul>
<li>parsing all thread dumps of a log file, using a specified regular expression for log file time stamps (thread dumps don't have any date information by default), displaying them in a tree.
<li>Display of statistic data about the found thread dumps, display of monitors, waiting, sleeping and locking threads,
<li>integrated class histogram analysis for a specific thread dump (using the -XX:+PrintClassHistogram option of the VM)
<li>parser interface for integrating dump parser for other VMs
<li>displays deadlock information.
<li>includes heap information for a thread dump (if parameter -XX:+PrintClassHistogram was included), can also be parsed from a second file, if loggc-Option was used (to log to a different VM)
</ul>

Features planned:
<ul>
<li>Storing of current session, to not to have to load all the log files again.
<li>Better Dump navigation with context sensitive dump information.
<li>More Parsers, including jmap (from JDK 1.5)
<li>Online request of a thread dump from a VM.
</ul>
<p>
The emphasis of the TDA is to provide analysis of offline information for production environment to get a first idea what is happening on the system, if it has problems and then do further analysis with projects like the <a href= "http://glassbox-inspector.dev.java.net/">Glassbox-Inspector</a>. In addition to TDA you might find the <a href="http://www.tagtraum.com/gcviewer.html">GCViewer</a> helpful. It parses the about of the garbage collector from a loggc file and displays it graphically.</p>

<p>TDA includes a short tutorial showing how to use the tool.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
You can download a first beta release in the <a href="/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">files</a> section. Look at the tutorial in the help menu for usage information. Start scripts are very basic at the moment, look inside them, you might need to adjust the memory settings.
</p>
<h2>Participation</h2>
<p>Please reports problems and ask questions in the <a href="/servlets/ProjectForumView">discussion forum</a>.</p>
<p>[A short paragraph informing interested people of the project's scope and to-dos. 
  You might wish instead to include a simple table listing to-dos or associated 
  projects, as below:]</p>

<p>Your a welcome to ask questions, report problems and make suggestions in the discussion forum.
