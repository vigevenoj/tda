TDA - Thread Dump Analyzer -- Version 1.2

To run the application use the scripts in the bin directory and open the log file to i
parse.

The analyzer will automatically parse and display all found dumps in the log file. 
As it reads all data into memory, Xmx setting in scripts might need to be set accordingly 
if big log files are read.

also be called from inside TDA.
