<p>Goal is to provide a small utility helping offline analysis of production enviroments like application servers.</p> 

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>There is a quite nice Thread Dump Analysis Tool for Websphere environments but which only works with IBM JDKs. Motivation for
this little tool was to have something similar for Sun JDKs. See <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javapedia/ThreadDump">JavaPedia: ThreadDump</a> for links.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The <b>TDA</b> Thread Dump Analyzer for Java is a small Swing GUI for analyzing Thread Dumps and Heap Information generated by the Sun Java VM (currently tested with 1.4.x releases). It parses the thread dumps and class histogram from a provided log file. TDA needs at least Java 1.4.x to run.</p>
<p>
It provides statistic informations about the found thread dumps, gives information about locked monitors and waiting threads. It can diff between threads to look for similarities and has a "long-running-thread" detection. It also provides overview of heap objects at a thread dump, if class histogram was logged.</p>
<p>
Features are in detail:
<ul>
<li>parsing all thread dumps of a log file, using a specified regular expression for log file time stamps (thread dumps don't have any date information by default), displaying them in a tree.
<li>Display of statistic data about the found thread dumps, display of monitors, waiting, sleeping and locking threads,
<li>integrated class histogram analysis for a specific thread dump (using the -XX:+PrintClassHistogram option of the VM), can also be parsed from a second file, if loggc-Option was used (to log garbage collections to a different log file).
<li>parser interface for integrating dump parser for other VMs
<li>displays deadlock information from the thread dump.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Features planned:
<ul>
<li>Storing of current session, to not to have to load all the log files again.
<li>Better Dump navigation with context sensitive dump information.
<li>More Parsers, including jmap (from JDK 1.5)
<li>request thread dumps remotely using jmx (for JDK's >= 1.5) <i>in progress</i>.
<li>Add additional logfiles (useful if logfiles are rotated) <i>done for next release</i>.
<li>If possible provide plugins for Eclipse and Netbeans.
<li>Parse hprof-file generated by -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError Option in VM.
</ul></p>
<p>
The emphasis of the TDA is to provide analysis of offline information for production environment to get a first idea what is happening on the system, if it has problems. Then do further analysis with projects like the <a href= "http://glassbox-inspector.dev.java.net/">Glassbox-Inspector</a> if you need to analyse the productions environment with low impact on the performance and load or with conventional tools if you can analyse the problem elsewhere.</p>

<p> In addition to TDA you might find the <a href="http://www.tagtraum.com/gcviewer.html">GCViewer</a> helpful. It parses the output of the garbage collector from a loggc file and displays it graphically, so you can analyse the memory usage over the time.</p>

<p>TDA includes a short tutorial showing how to use the tool.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
You can download the 1.0 Final release in the <a href="/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">files</a> section. Look at the tutorial in the help menu for usage information. Start scripts are very basic at the moment, look inside them, you might need to adjust the memory settings if you want to parse very huge log files (>250MB).</p>

<p><b>Update [2006/03/29]:</b> Fixed beta (updated download file) to work with JDK 1.4 and some other small bug fixes.</p>
<p><b>Update [2006/04/24]:</b> Final Release of 1.0, changes to Beta: regex for timestamps now working, long thread run detection, bugfixes.</p>
