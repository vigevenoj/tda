TDA - Thread Dump Analyzer -- Version 1.1

To run the application use the scripts in the bin directory and open the log file to i
parse.

The analyzer will automatically parse and display all found dumps in the log file. 
As it reads all data into memory, Xmx setting in scripts might need to be set accordingly 
if big log files are read.

Note: This is the 1.1 release of the software, for a tutorial see the doc directory (can 
also be called from inside TDA.

Changes from 1.0 are
* Ability to open more than one logfile at a time
* History of recent opened files
* Multiple regex for date parsing in settings (but only one active)
