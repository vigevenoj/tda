<p><a name="introduction"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
This is a short overview on how to use the TDA - Thread Dump Analyzer. TDA parses your log 
files and displays all found thread dumps and class histograms reported from a Sun JVM &gt;= 
1.4.x. Class Histograms are not included in the thread dumps by default but need a special 
JVM-Flag to be dumped with the thread dump. As TDA does everything offline and thread dumps 
have very low impact on the VM (including the class histogram option), it can be used for 
production environments. Note: There is a bug in early 1.5.x releases preventing the class 
histogram to be printed if any other than the concurrent mark sweep garbage collector is used.
</p>

<p>TDA can also be used as plugin in JConsole for requesting thread dumps from a remote virtual 
machine using JMX. See <i><a href="#plugin">Running as JConsole Plugin</a></i> for further information.
</p>

<p>
To have the class histograms included in your dumps you need to provide the -XX:+PrintClassHistogram 
option with the virtual machine's startup parameters of your application or application container.
</p>

<p><a name="introduction"><h3>Obtaining a thread dump at runtime</h3></a>
For requesting a thread dump, you need to send a kill-QUIT-Signal to the Java VM, for this you 
need the PID of the VM and then do a <pre>kill -QUIT &lt;PID&gt;</pre> in a Unix Environment. 
If you use Windows, you need a special tool for accomplishing this, e.g. SendSignal, see 
<a href="#references">References</a> for a link. It does the same like <pre>kill -QUIT</pre> on Windows-Systems. 
Beware: if you're using the remote connection on windows, you need to start the connection with 
<pre>mstsc.exe /console</pre> otherwise you won't have sufficient rights to use the tool. The JDK will 
then write the thread-dump to std-out. E.g. if your application is running in a tomcat, this would be 
catalina.out in a default tomcat installation.</p>

<p>Starting with Sun's JDK 1.5 you can also request a thread dump using the JVM utility <b>jstack</b>. jstack 
prints the thread dump into the shell window where you called it. To use the dump in TDA, pipe the output
into a log file and open this file. To analyze multiple dumps just append them to the log file. jstack also 
allows you to get thread dumps from javacore-files, either dumped on an OutOfMemoryError or using the
JVM tool jmap. On the windows platform this tool is available starting with JDK 1.6. It is not available 
at all on the linux-ia64 platform.
</p>

<p><a name="parsing"><h3>Sample Parsing Session</h3></a>
Open the log file you want to analyse, TDA will search for all thread dumps in this log file 
and displays them in a tree. Up to Sun's JDK 1.5 the VM doesn't log any date information when the dump 
was requested, you can provide a regular expression in the <b>Preferences</b> which is then used 
for parsing the lines before the thread dump to get a time stamp (see below for an example). In JDK 1.6 a 
time stamp is logged just before the dump, the default regular expression is set up to parse this time stamp. 
In <i><a href="#regex">Setting regular expression for time stamp parsing</a></i> you will find information 
on how to set up your own regular expression for time stamp parsing.</p>

<p><center><img src="info.png" border=0>
<br><i>Information about the selected dump</i></center></p>

<p>For each thread dump TDA sums up all found threads and all monitors found in the threads, it 
also groups threads waiting on, for and locking monitors. Clicking on the dump nodes itself will
provide you with information about the dump. If there is something special about it, TDA will give
you some hints on what to do next.</p> 

<p><center><img src="threaddumps.png" border=0>
<br><i>Thread Dump View</i></center></p>

<p>If you want to focus on a lock found in a thread you can just click on the monitor, TDA will then 
expand the <b>Monitor</b> node of the thread dump and focuses the clicked monitor. It will also give you
information about the monitor, if there is something special about, e.g. it has no obvious thread locking
the monitor but others waiting for it.</p>

<p>Starting here you can easily see if a thread is hanging and holding a lock which a lot 
of other threads are waiting for. If there aren't any locking threads but only waiting threads it is
very likely the garbage collector is locking the monitor currently. In this case you will get a hint
telling you about this.</p>

<p><center><img src="monitor.png" border=0>
<br><i>Monitors used by threads</i></center></p>

<p>If you added the -XX:+PrintClassHistogram to the VM-Parameters you will also see the class histogram 
for a thread dump, presented as node of the dump. Here you can examine all objects in the heap at the 
time of the thread dump. You can sort this view and filter it using the <b>Filter Expression</b>.</p>

<p><center><img src="histogram.png" border=0>
<br><i>Class Histogram of selected dump</i></center></p>

<p>If you use the loggc option with your VM to log the garbage collection information into a different log file, 
the heap dump will go into this log file instead of standard out and the TDA will not find it by default. To 
add the heap dump from a loggc file you need to use <b>Open loggc file...</b> in the popup menu of the thread dump pane. 
TDA will then parse this file backward and adds the found heap dumps to the thread dumps starting with the last dump. 
You can added multiple loggc-files, TDA will then continue after the last one where it added a heap dump 
with the last loggc-logfile or uses the dump you clicked on. 
</p>

<p>If your log file contains a lot of thread dumps done during one session of the VM currently analyzed, 
you can use <b>Find long running threads</b> in the tools menu to extract long running threads from the 
thread dumps. Currently this does also show waiting thread, so you need to search for threads actually 
doing something. Use appropriate filters to filter out all idle and uninteresting threads from the result.</p>

<p><a name="regex"><h3>Setting regular expression for time stamp parsing</h3></a>
Because the Sun JDK (&lt;=1.5.x) doesn't provide any time information when dumping threads a regular expression time 
stamp parsing for each line in the log file is included. TDA matches every line to the regular expression 
given in the preferences and stores the first matching group if the regular expression matches the line. 
It then takes the last match found as time stamp for the next thread dump to get a time stamp nearest to the 
thread dump. An example for such a regular expression is 
<pre>(\d\d\/\d\d\/\d\d\s\d\d:\d\d:\d\d).*</pre> 
This expression matches lines like 
<pre>06/02/14 14:54:04       at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:534)</pre> 
TDA then takes the first capturing group of the expression as time stamp. In this example the \d is for digits 
and the capturing group is included in the brackets and matches <i>06/02/14 14:54:04</i>. This is then stored 
as timestamp for the next thread dump. Starting with JDK 1.6 the SUN JDKs print out a time stamp in the line 
before the dump. The default regular expression recognizes this time stamp.</p>

<p>If the timestamp is stored in milliseconds since 1970 there is a checkbox in the preferences <i>Parsed 
timestamp is a long representing msecs since 1970</i> to tell TDA to convert the parsed time stamp from 
milliseconds into a human readable time stamp.</p> See <a href="#references">References</a> for detailed 
information about the regular expressions in java.

<p><a name="filters"><h3>Using filters</h3></a>
To filter out sleeping and uninteresting threads in your view you can use filters to just ignore these threads. 
For example if you use jgroups in your application and don't want to see als the STACKs and QUEUEs of jgroups you 
can specify something like that seen in the next screenshot.

<p><center><img src="filters.png" border=0>
<br><i>A filter filtering jgroups threads</i></center></p>

<p>The status bar will provide information about the number of filtered threads and how many are remaining. Note that changes
to the filters only apply after you changed a view. The filter changes will not be applied to the currently displayed thread view.</p>

<p>Filters can be used to match different parts of the thread information. You can match or search in stack, title and you can 
check for the thread state the thread is in. Filters can be including or excluding. The example above is a excluding
filter which checks if org.jgroups is in the stack information of a thread.</p>

<p><a name="deadlocks"><h3>Deadlocks</h3></a>
If the JVM finds a java level deadlock in your application it logs this into the thread dump. This information will
be displayed in the deadlock node of the dump. There is also a hint concerning the found deadlock(s) in
the dump summary. Note though, it doesn't have any deadlock
detection for java level deadlocks itself, it relies on the deadlock detection of the VM.</p>

<p><center><img src="deadlock.png" border=0>
<br><i>Deadlock informations</i></center></p>

<p>TDA also tries to find deadlocks which might be caused by some external resources or some remote communication 
   and can't be found by the Java VM. If there are indication for such a deadlock, TDA will display information concerning this
   in the dump summury and gives you hints what to do next.</p>
   
<p><a name="plugin"><h3>Running as JConsole Plugin</h3></a>
  TDA can be used as plugin in the JVM utility JConsole. Use the following to start JConsole with TDA as plugin: </p>
  <pre>jconsole -pluginpath ./tda.jar</pre>
  
  <p>The Plugin offers requesting thread dumps from a remote Virtual Machine through JMX. The Dumps are
  parsed and can be analyzed just like running as standalone-application. The upper-right-frame showing the dump tree has a popup menu offering 
the plugin features. The toolbar is also available for convenience, it can be switched off using the popup menu. The requested Thread Dumps can 
also be stored as Logfile for later offline analysis. The plugin supports requesting thread dumps from 1.5 and 1.6 VMs. The extended informations
from 1.6 are not parsed yet though (e.g. informations about locked synchronizers). But they are saved to the logfile also.</p>
   
<p><a name="sessions"><h3>Using Sessions</h3></a>
If you opened several logfiles and you want to quit TDA and go back to this logfiles later, you can store the open logfiles to a session file.
The logfile tree then is dumped into a session file for later usage. You must keep the logfiles if you want to be able to browse them again. For the
tree navigation they are not necessary.</p>
